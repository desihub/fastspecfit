2.4.1 (not released yet)
------------------------

* 

2.4.0 (2023-08-19)
------------------

* Bug fixes and miscellaneous feature requests for next VACs, including modified
  SPS templates and a user-friendly refactor of the K-correction code [`PR #148`_].

.. _`PR #148`: https://github.com/desihub/fastspecfit/pull/148

2.3.0 (2023-08-07)
------------------

* Support non-DR9 photometry via a new photometric configuration file [`PR #133`_].
* Miscellaneous updates and bug fixes ahead of next version of VACs [`PR #145`_].

.. _`PR #133`: https://github.com/desihub/fastspecfit/pull/133
.. _`PR #145`: https://github.com/desihub/fastspecfit/pull/145

2.2.0 (2023-08-02)
------------------

* Allow the Redrock redshift to be overridden [`PR #115`_].
* Code to support fitting stacked spectra [`PR #116`_].
* Bug fix of reversed tied flux ratio of [OII]7320,7330 doublet [`PR #120`_].
* Do not constrain the SPS age by default [`PR #132`_].
* Bug fix of emission-line subtracted Dn(4000) measurement [`PR #135`_].
* Update IGM attenuation coefficients [`PR #136`_].
* Several significant changes [`PR #137`_]:
  
  * Record the observed-space emission-line amplitude in ``_AMP`` and move the
    model-space amplitude to ``_MODELAMP``. 
  * Demand at least 12 pixels to measure the scatter in the pixels under the
    line (therefore ``_AMP_IVAR`` should be more reliable for narrow lines).
  * Major bug fix whereby the model emission-line spectra were not being
    convolved with the resolution matrix.
  * Redefine ``_CHI2`` for an emission line as the observed not reduced chi2.
  * Switch from (deprecated) ``pkg_resources`` to ``importlib``.
  * Updated documentation (data model) and several non-negligible speed-ups.

* Improved modeling of galaxies with broad+narrow line-emission [`PR #142`_]:
